# The groups database has two sections "images" and "spectra".
# Within these sections are subsections that are titled by the
# user-specified group names.
#
# Subsection (group) names must be valid in the database format used
# (config http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/configobj.html
# or yaml http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html).
# Also, subsection (group) names must not be bounded by parentheses.
# For example "(my_group)" is not a valid group name and will
# cause an error.
#
# Bounding with parentheses has a special meaning as described below.
#
# In the "images" section, the group subsections contain a
# sequence of names either of images (specified in the image database)
# or groups, but bounded by parentheses. For example, if a
# subsection (group) # name is called "abeta-fibers", then it may
# be referenced in the sequence for the group "abeta"
# by "(abeta-fibers)", as in the
# example group database.
# The "spectra" section is similar to the "images" section,
# except that the "spectra" section contains information only
# about spectra whereas the "images" section contains information
# only about images.
