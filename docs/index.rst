radialx Documentation
=====================

Introduction
------------

RadialX is a python package for working with x-ray
powder diffraction data and for simulating
x-ray powder diffraction patterns from models.

The most complete documentation is available at
http://pythonhosted.org/radialx/.

Documented Functionalities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At present, the only documented functionalities of RadialX are

1. The simulation of powder diffraction patterns
   from PDB files using the utility called **powderx**.

2. Displaying of diffraction image header information
   using the utility called **headerx**.

Detailed usage for powderx_ and headerx_ are below.

Undocumented Functionalities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Other, undocumented, functionalities correspond to "modes" of the
utility called **profilex**:

- *centering* mode: Finding the centers of powder diffraction images
  in adxv_ binary format.
- *averaging* mode: Radial integration of one or
  more experimental powder diffraction patterns in adxv_ binary format.
- *averaging* mode: Scaling of several powder experimental or simulated
  diffraction patterns to a single experimental or simulated pattern.
- *difference* mode: Calculating the difference of two scaled
  radially integrated experimental powder diffraction patterns.

Although **profilex** is fully functional and heavily tested, its
user interface (i.e. config file format, etc.) is very likely to
change. For example, the modes will probably be split into different
different utilities and several config file parameters will
probably be renamed.

It is hoped that the entire RadialX package
will be fully documented soon.

Home Page & Repository
----------------------

Home Page: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/radialx/

Documentation: http://pythonhosted.org/radialx/

Repository: https://github.com/jcstroud/radialx


Installation
------------

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

pip & setuptools
++++++++++++++++

The installation of RadialX and many other python packages will
be made easier by `pip`_. So, before going any further towards
installation, it is advisable to follow the
`pip installation instructions`_, including the
installation of setuptools described therein.
Setuptools is essential to pip.

CCTBX
+++++

At this point the `CCTBX package`_ is *only* needed to
simulate powder diffraction patterns with the **powderx** utility.

For **powderx**, it will be necessary to have the full CCTBX package installed
and the ``cctbx.python`` executable in your path. `Downloads are available`_
for numerous operating systems, including Mac OS X, Windows 7 & XP, and
several flavors of Linux. Additionally, it is possible to build
CCTBX from a source bundle or, for the more ambitious,
the SVN repository at sourceforge.

Because of the unusual python interpreter behavior forced by
the cctbx.python executable,
it is necessary to have all dependencies (except CCTBX itself)
installed both to the ``cctbx.python`` interpreter and to a system python
interpreter (e.g. at ``/usr/local/bin/python``).

The difficulty here might be in using pip with CCTBX if
you are using one of the pre-built CCTBX distributions
called "cctbx+Python" or "cctbx plus",
wherein the CCTBX distribution python
will be different from your system python.

One way to overcome this difficulty is simply to install all of the
packages twice, once to the CCTBX python
and once to the system python.

Installing to the system python interpreter is easy with pip.
For example, to install the pyfscache_ package::

  % sudo pip install pyfscache

Note that "``%``" is the prompt and is not actually typed.

For the CCTBX python, things are slightly more complicated. First, when
following the `pip installation instructions`_, use ``cctbx.python``
with ``ez_setup.py`` and ``get-pip.py``. For example::

  % sudo cctbx.python ez_setup.py
  % sudo cctbx.python get-pip.py

Once this latter command completes, you'll see among the final lines of output
something similar to::

  Installing pip script to /opt/cctbx/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin

The directory path in this output points to the location of CCTBX's pip,
which can be used directly. Using pyfscache_ as an example::

  % sudo /opt/cctbx/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/pip install pyfscache

.. _`pyfscache`: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfscache/


Other Dependencies
++++++++++++++++++

Other python dependencies are (in alphabetical order):

  - configobj_
  - numpy_
  - phyles_
  - PIL_
  - PyDBLite_
  - pyfscache_
  - pygmyplot_
  - pyyaml_
  - scipy_

If not already present on your system, most (if not all) of
these dependencies can be installed by the python package
manager called `pip`_.
The availability of each of these packages will be checked
during the `build`_ of RadialX by the ``setup.py`` script.

Download
~~~~~~~~

Because of the CCTBX dependency, it is not yet recommended
to install RadialX by using `pip`_.

For now, the best way to obtain RadialX is to download the source
code from the GitHub repository::

   % git clone https://github.com/jcstroud/radialx.git

This command automatically downloads and unpacks the complete
RadialX repository, which includes all of the code and some test data.


Build
~~~~~

It is advisable to look at the ``Makefile.inc`` file inside
the ``radialx`` directory to ensure that the settings reflect
your build environment. Most notably, ensure that the
``PYTHON`` setting points to the desired python version and
that the ``bin`` directory under the directory specified
by the ``PREFIX`` setting is in your path.

For example, if ``PREFIX`` is set to ``/usr/local``, then
ensure that ``/usr/local/bin`` is in your path.

These settings only affect how RadialX is built and where it is installed,
not how it will execute once installed.

Once downloaded, build and installation are easy::

   % cd radialx
   % make
   % sudo make install

The ``make`` command will automatically call ``setup.py`` and install
the utilities (``powderx``, ``headerx``, and ``profilex``) into
the appropriate location, specified by the ``PREFIX`` setting.


Usage
-----

Complete examples of how to use all of the RadialX utilites are
currently in the ``test`` directory of the `source distribution`_.
These examples are documented by comments in the config files called
``powder.yml`` and ``profile.cfg``, the latter serving presently
as the only source of documentation for the **profilex** utility.

Detailed instructions for the headerx_ and powderx_ utilities follow.

headerx
~~~~~~~

The **headerx** utility is the most straightforward to use. First,
convert an image file from the synchrotron or a home-source detector
to an adxv_ binary file. This function is found under the
``File`` â†’ ``Save..`` menu of adxv_. Ensure that the checkboxes
for "Image" and "Binary" are checked in the *Adxv Save*
window. I prefer to name these adxv binary files with the "``.bin``"
extension.

Using a filed called ``stsaa_119a_0_003.bin`` as an example::

  % headerx stsaa_119a_0_003.bin

This file is in the ``test/testdata`` directory and yields the following
output::

The "Sanity Test" is based on the header beam center. Hovering

the given resolutions (depending on what adxv thinks is the beam center).

powderx
~~~~~~~

The **powderx** utility simulates powder diffraction patterns
from PDB files. These patterns are presented graphically and
also written to a file name designated by the user, as described
below.

The powderx Config File
+++++++++++++++++++++++

A yaml_ formatted config file controls the behavior of **powderx**.
This config file is specified as an argument on the command line::

  powderx powder.yml

An example config file named ``powder.yml`` is in the ``test/test-powder``
directory of the source distribution. The powder config file will be
referred to as "``powder.yml``" herein. The provided example file
has comments that briefly describe each parameter. It is suggested just
to copy and modify the example ``powder.yml`` file from the
``test/test-powder`` directory of the source distribution because
its format may change slightly between versions of RadialX.

An introduction to the `yaml config format`_ is given below and provides
everything users need to know about yaml to write a config file
for **powderx**. For the curious, the full yaml specification (version 1.2) can
be found at http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html.

The ``powder.yml`` file has three sections:

- ``general``: parameters that effect the user experience
- ``simulation``: parameters for the powder diffraction simulation
- ``plot``: parameters that modify the appearance of the plot
- ``experiment``: parameters of the simulated diffraction experiment

A detailed discussion of each section follows.

general
#######

Parameters in the ``general`` section effect the user experience to
a limited extent.

- ``powderx_version``: version number of the **powderx** program;
  it is critical for the config file version to match the version
  of the **powderx** program
- ``verbosity``: controls how verbose the output is;
  values may be ``DEBUG`` (most verbose), ``INFO``, ``WARNING``,
  ``ERROR``, or ``CRITICAL`` (least verbose)

simulation
##########

Of the three sections in ``powder.yml``, the ``simulation`` section
has the most parameters. Most of these parameters are self-explanatory.

- ``pdb_name``: pdb file from which to make a simulated pattern
- ``pattern_name``: the simulated pattern is written to a file
  of this name; the `simulated pattern format`_ is described below
- ``d_max``: maximum d-spacing (lowest resolution) for the
  simulation, given in Ã…ngstroms.
- ``d_min``: minimum d-spacing (highest resolution) for the
  simulation, given in Ã…ngstroms.
- ``extinction_correction_x``: an optional parameter refined during
  extinction correction, which is applied to the simulated pattern;
  this correction is discussed in the SHELXL 97 manual on page 7-7
  (http://shelx.uni-ac.gwdg.de/SHELX/shelx97.pdf); use ``null``
  or ``0`` if extinction correction is not desired
- ``v`` & ``w``: for the summation of reflections, the square
  of the full-width at half-max (FWHM) of a Lorentzian diffraction
  peak is equal to to v + w tan(Î¸)
- ``B``: isotropic temperature factor; if the simulated pattern
   is to be scaled with experimental data, then ``B`` should be
   set to 0 because it will be refined during scaling
- ``apply_Lp``: apply Lorentz & polarization correction
  (``True`` or ``False``)
- ``pattern_shells``: number of points in the simulated pattern;
  each point represents the integrated intensity of the shell
- ``peak_widths``: the intensity of a reflection is taken to be
  0 beyond this number of FWHM from the center of the Lorentzian
  reflection peak
- ``bin_reflections``: reflections may be binned by resolution such
  that all the reflections within a shell
  (specified by ``pattern_shells``) are taken to have the
  same center and peak shape (i.e. the same FWHM),
  making the calculations significantly faster at
  the expense of a small decrease in accuracy;
  values for ``bin_reflections`` may be ``True`` or ``False``

plot
####

The ``plot`` section controls the appearance of the plot.

- ``window_name``: name of the plot window
- ``left``, ``right``, ``top``, ``bottom``:
  margins between plot and page border; note that axes labels
  are in the margins
- ``plot_points``: the data is rebinned simply for the purposes
  of the plot; the plot will have ``plot_points`` points
- ``x_ticks``: number of ticks on the x-axis; labeled
  by 2Î¸.


experiment
##########

A simulated diffraction pattern is the result of a simulated
experiment. The parameters of the ``experiment`` section specify
simulated experimental details.

- ``WAVELENGTH``: radiation wavelength
- ``DISTANCE``: the distance from the sample to the detector

Please note that yaml is case-sensitive, so these latter
two parameter names must be in all caps.


Summation
+++++++++

The simulated powder diffraction pattern is the spherical
summation of diffraction intensity over each resolution shell,
where the number of resolution shells is specified by the ``patern_shells``
setting of the **powderx** config file.
Each shell is summed independently. All shells have the same
width in :math:`\varrho`, or :math:`\sin(\theta)/\lambda`, where
:math:`\theta` is the Bragg angle and :math:`\lambda` is
the wavelength.

Given that the structure factor for a Miller index, :math:`hk\ell`,
is :math:`F_{hk\ell}`, then the corresponding intensity
:math:`I_{hk\ell}` is

.. math::

    I_{hk\ell} =
      \dfrac{M}{V^{2}}
      \left [
        \dfrac{1 + \cos^{2}(2\theta)}
               {\sin^{2}\theta \cos\theta}
      \right ]
      F_{hk\ell} F_{hk\ell}^{*}
      \exp \left (
              \dfrac{-2B\sin^{2}\theta}{\lambda^{2}}
           \right )

Where :math:`V` is the unit cell volume, :math:`M` is
the multiplicity of the reflection, and :math:`B` the isotropic
temperature factor.

If the simulated pattern is to be scaled to
experimental data using the **profilex** utility,
:math:`B` should be set to 0 because :math:`B` is
refined during scaling. Note that when :math:`B`
is set to 0, the expression for diffraction intensity
simplifies to

.. math::

    I_{hk\ell} =
      \dfrac{M}{V^{2}}
      \left [
        \dfrac{1 + \cos^{2}(2\theta)}
               {\sin^{2}\theta \cos\theta}
      \right ]
      F_{hk\ell} F_{hk\ell}^{*}

The term
:math:`\dfrac{1 + \cos^{2}(2\theta)}{\sin^{2}\theta \cos\theta}`
is the Lorentz polarization correction, which may be applied
to the simulated pattern using the ``apply_Lp`` setting
within the ``simulation`` section of the config file.

Diffraction intensities are distributed throughout a profile,
approximated by **powderx** as a `Lorentzian distribution`_ (also
called a "Cauchy distribution"). This distribution takes the form

.. math::

    A_{J}^{L} = \dfrac{2}{\pi H_{B}}
       \left [1 + \dfrac{4}{H_{B}^{2}}
                  \left ( 2\theta_{i} - 2\theta_{hk\ell} \right )^2
       \right ]^{-1}

Where :math:`A_{J}^{L}` is the intensity contribution
at angle :math:`\theta_{i}`, :math:`H_{B}` is the FWHM
of the peak, and :math:`\theta_{hk\ell}` is the angle of
diffraction for the Miller index :math:`hk\ell`.  
For the purposes of the simulation, :math:`\theta_{i}` is taken
from the middles (in :math:`\varrho`) of the shells.

Because it is computationally expensive to calculate the contribution
of every reflection to every shell, **powderx** allows the user
to limit the calculations to the shells in the neighborhood
of :math:`\theta_{i}` using the ``peak_widths`` setting. This setting
specifies the width of the neighborhood in multiples of the FWHM.

The FWHM, or :math:`H_{B}`, can be expressed as a function of the Bragg
angle of the reflection:

.. math::

  H_{B}^{2} = v \tan \theta_{hk\ell} + w

The two parameters of this expression, :math:`v` and :math:`w`
may be adjusted using the config file settings ``v`` and ``w``,
respectively.

File Formats
------------

Simulated Pattern Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simulated integrated diffraction pattern is written to a yaml
formatted file specified by the ``pattern_name`` setting
in the ``simulation`` section of ``powder.yml``. In yaml terms, the
pattern is stored as a list of [2Î¸, intensity] pairs keyed by
the word "``pattern``".
A python program can make a 2-D numpy_ array from the pattern easily
if numpy_ (http://numpy.scipy.org/) and pyYAML_ (http://pyyaml.org/)
are installed.  For example, if the pattern is stored in the
file "``pattern.yml``"::

      import numpy
      import yaml
      ary = numpy.array(yaml.load(open('pattern.yml')))['pattern']

The array called "``ary``" is a Nx2 array, with each of the N rows being a
[2Î¸, intensity] pair.

More generally, the pattern starts on the fourth line of the yaml
file and each data line conforms to the following FORTRAN
formatted read::

      REAL X, Y
      READ '(5X, F10.0, 1X, F10.0)', X, Y

The following are the first six lines of a yaml simulated powder diffraction
pattern file::

      model : "../testdata/stg06-phi06.4-wc-03.8-rc1.0-m4-12.pdb"
      pattern :
        # [   2-theta, intensity ]
        - [  5.205029, 0.5671240 ]
        - [  5.285076, 0.5882654 ]
        - [  5.365124, 0.6002413 ]

.. _pyYAML: http://pyyaml.org/


YAML Config Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``powder.yml`` file has a simple structure, which can be understood
from the following listing::

   %YAML 1.2
   ---
   section_1 :
      parameter_a : value_a
      parameter_b : value_b
   section_2 :
      parameter_c : value_c

Here, the first line is optional and indicates to a yaml parser that
the file conforms to the yaml specification version 1.2. The second
line of three dashes indicates the beginning of a yaml document.
Each section name is on a line by itself and followed by a colon.
Each parameter key-value pair is *indented* relative to 
the section names. All parameter key-value pairs are indented the
same number of spaces.
A colon separates the parameter key from its
associated value.

Note that yaml is case sensitive.
