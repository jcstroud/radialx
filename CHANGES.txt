0.8.9, 2014-03-14 -- Updated README for version 0.8, finally.
                     Added difference plot to difference mode.
                     Added new options to differenc mode config,
                     for plot to work and to create a database
                     record for pattern database.
                     Fixed a bug in difference mode where
                     the two-theta angles in the difference file
                     are incorrect.

0.8.8, 2014-03-13 -- Fixed bug in difference mode of profilex.
                     Fixed sense of positive and negative images with
                     respect to scaling and buoyancy in difference mode.
                     The negative image is now the reference image
                     and the positive image is buoyant.
                     Also allowed selection of scaling target
                     for difference mode: background, simple, or none.
                     Updated test/example profile.cfg file accordingly.
                     Finally, fixed plotting bug where averaged patterns
                     were not smoothed in the plot if they were scaled.

0.8.7, 2014-01-15 -- Small improvements to the docs.

0.8.6, 2014-01-15 -- Small improvements to the docs.

0.8.5, 2014-01-15 -- Added background correction to plotting and
                     documented scaling, background correction,
                     and the goodness of fit statistic.

0.8.4, 2014-01-14 -- Changed the optimization in profilex scaling
                     to fit background, which added an extra fitting
                     parameter, but makes more sense.

0.8.3, 2014-01-10 -- Fixed bug where integration returned bin averages
                     instead of summation in averaging mode of profilex.

0.8.2, 2014-01-10 -- Forgot to change Pillow dependency back to PIL
                     on previous release.

0.8.1, 2014-01-10 -- Improvements to the summation part of the docs.
                     Fully documented the combine_reflections setting
                     of **powderx**. Renamed the bin_reflections
                     setting to combine_reflections.

0.8.0, 2014-01-10 -- Mostly just a documentation improvement and
                     a version bump to reflect the temperature
                     factor and Lp correction added yesterday.
                     Added mathjax support to docs.

0.7.2, 2014-01-09 -- Added documentation for the powder summation.
                     Also, the user now has control over isotropic
                     temperature factor and Lp correction in powderx.
                     Fixed behavior of profilex for scaling multiple
                     patterns.

0.7.1, 2014-01-08 -- Fixed some documentation.

0.7.0, 2014-01-08 -- Ready for pypi release.
                     Uitilities tested and functionalities
                     are consistent. Documented. Bam!

0.2.2, 2013-12-20 -- Initial release.
